### Intro to Android.

What is Android?

Android is often considered to be an operating system, but it is also a software stack that consists of (1) An operating system (Linux) and (2) a framework for developing applications.
It also includes a number of key applications (such as contacts) that reflect its purpose as a mobile platform.
Despite being notionally owned by Google, Android is open source. The complete source code can be downloaded and modified if you wish.

### Setup and Installation.

Get Android Studio from developer.android.com
The site should automatically recognise you are using a mac. (We will be using 3.0 or higher for this course).
Install the dmg in the usual way (drag to applications).
Launch Android Studio.
Select 'do not import settings'.
Install standard and select the theme of your choice.
Finish on default settings. (This may take a while to d/l).


### Configure SDK Options.

The SDK, or Software Development Kit is a collection of all the classes that make up Android in addition to the emulators and other tools.
Launch Android Studio and click configure.
Navigate to the SDK manager. This is where we can install additional features and install any updates should they be available. Installing the latest SDK should be enough. Previous SDKs are only necessary if you are working on legacy code or something of that nature.
*Note. Installing multiple sdks can use large amounts of disk space.
