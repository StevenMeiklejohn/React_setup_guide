###Compare Files/Diff.

It can sometimes be useful to compare two files either containing code/logic or xml. Perhaps with a previous working revision. To do this we can use the diff tools Android Studio provides. To make this process as easy as possible it is recommended that every time you complete (or check into git) a code or xml file do the following;

code/reformat_code.

This reorders the code into a standardised format. If you have performed this operation on all your code the results of the diff tools will be much easier to parse.

To run a comparison, click on the file you would like to compare in the project pane, then click;

view/compare_with

And navigate to the file you would like to compare against.
